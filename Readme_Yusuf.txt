LinkedIn Scrapper 
(put in software enginerr job hunt note):

*Use Vpn

Config.json (inputs):
*Job title & location (just like linkedin)
*Languages: "en"
-to get only english job ads
*With every search: delete: data-> mydatabase.db & excel files (main directory)
(update code to do that)

Notes: 
-in my app: filter job adds are viewed
-Config.json is usable tool to change code without opening code (file for inputs)
